      <p><strong>Trust Hold Pay</strong> provides neutral escrow services for digital transactions. By using our services, you agree to the following terms:</p>

      <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
      <p>We act as a neutral third party to hold funds until the buyer and seller fulfill the agreed conditions of a transaction.</p>

      <h2>2. Fees</h2>
      <p>Our standard fee is <strong>1–3%</strong> depending on the amount, risk level, and complexity. The minimum fee is <strong>$20</strong>. Fees may go up to <strong>5%</strong> for large or high-risk transactions.</p>

      <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Both parties must agree on the transaction terms before funds are sent.</li>
        <li>All information provided must be accurate and truthful.</li>
        <li>Trust Hold Pay is not responsible for product/service quality disputes unless agreed terms are violated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Disputes</h2>
      <p>If a dispute arises, we may request documentation and proof from both parties. We reserve the right to hold, refund, or release funds based on our assessment. Complex cases may be escalated to a third-party arbitrator.</p>

      <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Escrow fees are non-refundable once the transaction begins. Funds can only be refunded to the sender if both parties agree or a dispute is resolved in their favor.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>We only collect essential data for communication and transaction verification. We never sell or share your data with third parties.</p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>We are not liable for losses beyond the amount held in escrow. We do not guarantee outcomes outside of the escrow terms.</p>
